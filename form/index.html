        <h1>Brooklyn </h1>
        <div class="last-div">
            <p>Brooklyn was originally a Dutch village called Breukelen, located on the banks of the East River, on Long Island.

                The west coast of Long Island was inhabited by the American Indians of the Canarsie tribe, who ceded their land to New Netherland. The Dutch West India Company founded as many as six cities on this site:
                
                Gravesend (English Gravesend) (1645), the only English in the colony;
                Breukelen (Dutch. Breuckelen) (1646), named after the village of Breuckelen - the future Brooklyn;
                Nieuw Amersfoort (Dutch. Nieuw Amersfoort) (1647), named after the city of Amersfoort - the future Flatlands;
                Midwout (Dutch. Midwout) (1652) - the future Flatbush (English Flatbush);
                Nieuw Utrecht (Dutch. Nieuw Utrecht) (1657), named after the city of Utrecht - the future Bensonhurst;
                Boswijk (Dutch. Boswijck) (1661) - the future Bushwick (Eng. Bushwick).
                In 1664, the British conquered New Netherland, and all the settlements of Brooklyn became part of the New York colony. They began to expand, and in 1854 Brooklyn became a city. Although Brooklyn is part of the city of New York, it looks like a city in its own right, which cannot be said of, for example, the Bronx.
                
                “…before the creation of “Greater New York” in 1898, Brooklyn was the third most populous city in the United States (after New York and Chicago itself). What is the rather big (and almost empty) building of the former municipality. When the Brooklyn Museum was laid out, it was supposed to be larger than the Louvre. In response to Manhattan's Central Park, the Brooklynites hired the same architects to equip Prospect Park, similar in purpose ... ". In a referendum on unification with New York a few years earlier, only about 51% of Brooklyn voters voted yes.
                
                Demography
                Brooklyn had a population of 2,504,701 in 2010, according to the US Census Bureau.
                
                More Russian speakers live in Brooklyn than in other boroughs in New York City.</p>
